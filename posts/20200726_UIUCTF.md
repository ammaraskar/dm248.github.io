# UIUCTF

##### Jul 26, 2020

I tried a couple problems at [UIUCTF](https://ctftime.org/event/1075) last weekend, crypto and pwn
mostly. It had an interesting mixture of simple and hard problems with not much in between. Overall,
it was both fun and educational.

On the easy side:

### Isabelle's file encryption

### Coelacanth vault

### Accounting accidents

On the hard side:

### Bot Protection IV

### Gen Z Math Class

### Nookcrypt
