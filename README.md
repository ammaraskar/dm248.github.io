# NahamCon 

##### Jun 15, 2020

[NahamCon CTF](https://ctftime.org/event/1067) was a fun event last weekend.
I only had about 10 hours for it, so I did what tends to suit me best: crypto plus some misc challenges.
Overall I scored close to 1500, which is OK but there is always room to do more.
Here are some of my thoughts about the [problems..](/posts/20200615_NahamCon.md)

# Where's the Sat @ Hack-A-Sat

##### Jun 7, 2020

Two weeks ago, the USAF and DDS put up a [Hack-A-Sat](https://www.hackasat.com/) space hacking challenge.
I only had time to check out a handful of the problems, one of which was Where's the Sat that asked people
to identify a satellite by location and time and then predict where it would be at another time. It turns out
that with the
right tools, such as [Skyfield](https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/), the problem is straightforward 
(check, e.g., [here](https://medium.com/@pdelteil/wheres-the-sat-hack-a-sat-writeup-9a523634963b)). 
But the solution is not very satisfying unless one understands what goes on inside the black box... 
so if you are curious, [read on](/posts/20200607_Wheres_the_Sat.md)...

# GitHub Pages

##### Jun 6, 2020

I decided to give [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
a try so that I do not have to bother with hosting these posts elsewhere.
Take-off was quite smooth but not without a few [hiccups...](posts/20200606_GitHub_Pages.md)
